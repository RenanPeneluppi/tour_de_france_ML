In this folder you will find a Jupyter workbook for the scrapping process, 
another one for the data modeling process and a PDF file with the project report. 

Also I'd like to note I'm aware of not using the correct Train, validation, test data split. 
Since I spent so much time on the scrapping and cleanning process I did not have as much time as I'd like to work on the models. 
I also realized quickly that my data needs improvement in order to run reliable models, as explained on the report
so I chose to go with ontly the Train, Test split to save some time on this step.

I somehow deleted the folder containning my Tableau visualizations, but they can be found on the presentation submited earlyer. 
I did not add the data collected as it's just huge folder, but if that is required for checking my work feel free to get in touch with me.

I appologize if my notebooks are not super organized, I did have some trouble focusing on the past week and realize I could have done a better job on that.
